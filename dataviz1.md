# Discussion

The data used in each of these visualizations comes from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's data on general government debt. Each of these charts uses the debt-to-GDP ratio, which measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of its GDP. According to the OECD's website, the ratio is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

The first bar chart only shows each country’s debt-to-GDP ratio for 2018. It allows the viewer to compare countries’ debt side by side for that year. The next two visualizations both display the debt-to-GDP ratio over time. The grid of line charts lets the viewer compare the general trends from each of the countries and provides for easy comparison since each chart uses the same scale. Because the third chart allows the viewer to toggle between different countries, they can view the progression of each country’s debt-to-GDP ratio across the years up close. Each chart, however, has a different scale on the y axis so it does not allow for easy comparison. 

I chose the third visualization because, from the grid of line charts, it was hard to view details about the data from the charts since they are so small. The line chart that I used for the third visualization allows users to see the same data as was in the grid, just on a larger scale and specific to each country.
