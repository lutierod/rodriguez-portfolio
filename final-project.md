# The Digital Divide's Impact on Arts Participation

## Summary
In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many arts organizations have turned to online platforms to continue to provide access to their work while people cannot gather in person. Many have indicated that this generally allows increased access to the organization since ticket prices and physical barriers are limited. Internet access, however, is not as universal as many arts administrators may think. Through my final project, I want to show the "digital divide" that exists in the United States and how it impacts people’s access to online content, encouraging arts organizations to find alternatives to engage the community as the pandemic continues. 

## Outline

**Setup:** In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many arts organizations have turned to online content as a way to engage with their patrons when gathering in person is not feasible.

**Conflict:** Because of the digital divide in the United States, not everyone has access to these online resources.

I. Rural Americans are more likely to lack access to broadband internet

II. The digital divide particularly impacts lower-income Americans

**Resolution:** As the pandemic continues, and the arts sector is likely to be one of the last industries to return to in person operations, arts organizations can implement offline alternatives to engagement, such as radio broadcasts and education packet distribution. 

### User story:
The main users that I am targeting with my story are arts managers who are in charge of programming content throughout the pandemic. Their user statement is, "As an arts manager, I want to find an effective way to continue operations during the pandemic so that my organization can engage the largest part of the community."

A subset of this group that could benefit from this story would be arts education managers or teaching artists. Their user statement is, "As an arts education manager/teaching artist, I want to find an effective way to educate students during the pandemic so that none of them miss out on this extracurricular activity."

### Call to action: 
"I can do this by innovating new remote opportunities that do not involve the internet, such as distributing packets, radio broadcasts, etc."

For both groups of users, the call to action from this story will be to innovate safe, offline engagement opportunities. I will also include some examples of existing alternatives from arts groups. 

## Data
My primary data source for this assignment will be the Federal Communications Commission's [2019 Broadband Deployment Report](https://www.fcc.gov/document/broadband-deployment-report-digital-divide-narrowing-substantially-0). The FCC chooses to use access to modern broadband networks as an indication of which Americans can participate and thrive in a digital environment. Their performance benchmark for fixed services is a speed of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps because "it enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications.” The report provides data for the United States as a whole (broken down into rural and urban areas), for each state (also broken down into rural and urban), and for individual counties. The report also includes information about mobile LTE access, but I will be focusing on broadband access for my story. I will use the data from the FCC's Broadband Deployment report to display how many people in the U.S. lack broadband internet access and show which groups are most impacted by the digital divide.

To connect the importance of internet access to the arts sector, I will also use data from Culture Track's [Culture & Community in a Time of Crisis](https://s28475.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CCTC-Key-Findings-from-Wave-1_9.29.pdf) report, which details how people are connecting with arts organizations during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will also use data from the Americans for the Arts' [Economic Impact of Coronavirus on the Arts and Culture Sector](https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-topic/disaster-preparedness/the-economic-impact-of-coronavirus-on-the-arts-and-culture-sector) dashboard, which includes information about how arts organizations are pivoting their programming in response to the pandemic. Both of these data sources will help me show that providing online content is the main way that arts organizations have responded to not being able to gather in large crowds.

## Method and medium
I will complete my final project by creating a story using Shorthand. I will use both text and charts generated by Flourish and Tableau to convey my message. From these initial sketches I presented on this page, I will use the data from the above sources to create cleaner visualizations on Flourish and Tableau. After doing more research into how some arts organizations have used "analog" methods to distribute their content, I will also begin crafting the written story around my visualizations.
