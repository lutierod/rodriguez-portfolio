Lutie Rodriguez's portfolio for Telling Stories with Data (F20) at Carnegie Mellon

# About me
Hello! My name is Lutie Rodriguez (she/her) and I am a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. This is my second year as a Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College.  After graduation, I hope to help arts organizations communicate more effectively about themselves and about their impact. I am also interested in foundation work to ensure a sustainable future for the arts in the United States. Currently, I am the chief editor of the Arts Management and Technology Laboratory, a CMU-affiliated research center. My interests include cultural policy, technology adoption in the arts, music, and writing. 

# What I hope to learn
I am passionate about helping arts organizations communicate more effectively, including through data. I want to learn the tools that make more impactful data visualizations for both internal and external use. One of my undergraduate degrees was in writing, so I am excited to discover how to apply those communication skills to data visualization.
