## Final revisions

From user feedback and before publishing my final story, the main changes I made were making some of the charts more understandable, fleshing out the solutions section, and making a more engaging call to action. The first visualization I revised was the unit chart that originally compared the number of people out of 100 that would lack broadband internet access in rural vs. urban areas. From feedback in class, I realized that introducing the divide that early would be confusing, and I wanted to find a context that would be relevant to arts organizations. I chose to visualize how many people in the Kennedy Center, a national performing arts venue, wouldn't have broadband internet access if all the seats were full with average U.S. residents.

For the map visualization, I made the key and each state's labeling more clear. I also made sure that the map was "stuck" in the postion I wanted. 

One of my interviewees suggested segmenting the possible solutions so that arts leaders viewing my story could find a solution relevant to them. I did this by dividing the example solutions I found into local, regional, national, reservation-based, and international.
