## Final revisions

From user feedback and before publishing my final story, the main changes I made were making some of the charts more understandable, fleshing out the solutions section, and making a more engaging call to action. The first visualization I revised was the unit chart that originally compared the number of people out of 100 that would lack broadband internet access in rural vs. urban areas. From feedback in class, I realized that introducing the divide that early would be confusing, and I wanted to find a context that would be relevant to arts organizations. I chose to visualize how many people in the Kennedy Center, a national performing arts venue, wouldn't have broadband internet access if all the seats were full with average U.S. residents.

For the map visualization, I made the key and each state's labeling more clear. I also made sure that the map was "stuck" in the postion I wanted. 

One of my interviewees suggested segmenting the possible solutions so that arts leaders viewing my story could find a solution relevant to them. I did this by dividing the example solutions I found into local, regional, national, reservation-based, and international. Following this list of sample solutions, I tried to make a clearer, more motivating call to action for arts managers. I also made a second call to action for people who may have found the story but do not work in the arts sector. 

Although this was not specifically mentioned in feedback, I wanted my story to be more visually unified so I selected a color scheme and used images that fit my theme. I also unified the font used on the visualizations and throughout the story.
