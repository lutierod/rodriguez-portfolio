# User research protocol
I have a fairly specific target audience for my story: arts administrators who are working in some capacity with adapting programming for the pandemic environment. Because of this, I wanted to interview people for my research who are in that target audience, or at least understood the considerations involved in that type of role. I also know that the programming museums have to adapt to the pandemic world is very different from performing arts programming, so I wanted to get representatives from both of these areas. Several of the examples in my project are also related to education, so I wanted to find at least one person with knowledge in that area.

The subjects I ended up with were:
1. Woman in her 20s with a background in performing arts who is in the arts management field and currently interns for a visual arts-based education nonprofit
2. Woman in her 20s in the arts management field who works in the visual arts sector and has a background in museums
3. Man in his 30s who is a musician and teaching artist
