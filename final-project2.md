# Storyboard and wireframes
[Shorthand: The Digital Divide's Impact on Arts Participation](https://preview.shorthand.com/dLt0DGBx5VIh0FkV)

# User research protocol
I have a fairly specific target audience for my story: arts administrators who are working in some capacity with adapting programming for the pandemic environment. Because of this, I wanted to interview people for my research who are in that target audience, or at least understood the considerations involved in that type of role. I also know that the programming museums have to adapt to the pandemic world is very different from performing arts programming, so I wanted to get representatives from both of these areas. Several of the examples in my project are also related to education, so I wanted to find at least one person with knowledge in that area.

The subjects I ended up with were:
1. Woman in her 20s in the arts management field who works in the visual arts sector and has a background in museums
2. Woman in her 20s with a background in performing arts who is in the arts management field and currently interns for a visual arts-based education nonprofit
3. Man in his 30s who is a musician and teaching artist

## Inteview script

**Intro:** My goal today is to get feedback on a data-based web story I'm creating. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. I'm still working on the design elements, but the general outline of the story and visualizations are there. All feedback is anonymous, and the total process should take less than 15 minutes of your time. I've sent you a link to the story if you want to open it and scan through it. 

**Questions:** 
- In your own words, what do you think this story is about?
- Who do you think is the intended audience?
- Was anything about the story confusing?
- Once you finished, was there anything you wanted to know more about?
- Did the story make you want to act?
- Do you have any additional comments? 

**Wrap-up:** Thank you for your time! Do you have any questions about the project for me? 

## Findings
Going into this, I think I had gotten too much in my head about the story making sense and following a logical progression. But, most of the feedback had to do wth the examples I used. My subjects were more interested in how solutions could be implemented. 

Whenever we did peer reviews in class, I got a few comments on my map visualization being a bit confusing because of the key and the fact that it automatically Zoomed to Iceland on the page. I made a few adjustments before including it in my storyboard, but a couple of my subjects still had questions specifically about it. 

## Going forward
